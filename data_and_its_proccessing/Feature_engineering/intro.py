"""
Feature Transformation(DATA PROCESSING ITSELF)
    -> missing values(remove or fill)
    -> Categorial data
    -> Outliers(detect and remove)
    -> Scaling
Feature Construction
    -> Create a new feature based on other columns based on the domain knowledge
Feature Selection 
    -> drop uneccesary features
Feature extraction
    -> transforming high-dimensional space to a lower-dimentional space.
       It focuses on reducing the number of features while retaining the essential info
        To reduce the dimensionality of the data, which can help to mitigate the curse of dimensionality, 
        reduce computational cost, and eliminate redundant or irrelevant features.
        Ex: PCA  , LDA , ICA ,autoencoders
    #  Both processes aim to improve model performance but operate in different ways: construction 
       adds new features, while extraction reduces and condenses the existing features.
